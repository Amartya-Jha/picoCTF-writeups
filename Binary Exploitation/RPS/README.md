## Problem Statement

Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row.
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56981
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.

## Type

Binary Exploitation

## Hints

1. How does the program check if you won?

## Approach

In the source code provided we can see that the functions checks wheter the winning move is a substring or not so we just enter `rockpaperscissors` 5 times and get the flag.
