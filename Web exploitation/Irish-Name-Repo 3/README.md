## Problem Statement

There is a secure website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/40742/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:40742. Try to see if you can login as admin!

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. Seems like the password is encrypted.

## Approach

Using intercept on the link and changing debug value to 1, we get the sql quesry and see that rot13 is being applied on the input, so we apply rot13 our input.

on using `' be 1=1;` we get our flag.

## Flag
