## Problem Statement

[Factory Login](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/)

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

## Approach

I used username: admin and password: admin to login but any thing will work.
On checking the cookies there's a cookie named Admin with value set to False, using the cookie editor and changing that value to True and refreshing the page we get out Flag.
