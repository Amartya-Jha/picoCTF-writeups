then i checked my cookies and the value was 0,
next i put choco chip in the input and the value changed to 1.

I used a cookie editor [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm?hl=en) to edit the value of the cookies and after a few hit and trials
i got the flag for value 18.
