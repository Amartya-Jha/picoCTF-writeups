# Insp3ct0r

## Problem Statement

[here](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/)

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
2. There's 3 parts

## Approach

press ctrl + shift + i to inspect the webpage, in the html code we find the first part of the flag: "picoCTF{tru3_d3"

now we move to the stylesheet and the 2nd part of the flag is there: "t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t"

only js file is left and there we find out final piece: "_lucky?f10be399}"

## Flag

picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}
