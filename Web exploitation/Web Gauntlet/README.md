# Web Gauntlet

## Problem Statement

Can you beat the filters? Log in as admin http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:19593/ http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:19593/filter.php

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. You are not allowed to login with valid credentials.
2. Write down the injections you use in case you lose your progress.
3. For some filters it may be hard to see the characters, always (always) look at the raw hex in the response.
4. sqlite
5. If your cookie keeps getting reset, try using a private browser window


## Approach

1. trying admin for username and pass we get the following prompt: 
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admin'`.
 
 so i tried to use only username field and commented out the rest using the following username: `admin';--` and moved to round 2.

2. I see that `--` is filtered so we just get rid of that part and use `admin';` as input for both username and pass and move to round 3.

3. used the previous injection in this one and moved to round 4.

4. `abc'/**/UNION/**/select/**/*/**/from/**/users/**/limit/**/1;`
using union to execute another command to retrieve first row from users.

5. using `||` for string concatenation.
`'adm'||'in';`
