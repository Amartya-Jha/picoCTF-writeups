# Who are you

## Problem Statement

Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:1270/

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616

## Approach

On visiting the given website we see the prompt: Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!
on looking up how to change that field i learned that it can be done so by editing the headers. So i installed a header editing [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader-modify-http-hea/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj/related) and edited the User-Agent to PicoBrowser.

2nd prompt: I don't trust users visiting from another site.
which can be changed by using "Referer" header with value "http://mercury.picoctf.net:1270/"

3rd prompt: Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.
Using "Date" header with value "Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT" (i had to look up the proper format).

4th prompt: This website is only for people from Sweden.
I changed the "X-Forwarded_For" header to a Swedish ip-address "70.34.208.62"

5th prompt: You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?
Using "Accept-Langauge" header with value "sv" we get our flag.
