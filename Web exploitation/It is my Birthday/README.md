# It is my Birthday

## Problem Statement

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:11590/

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. Look at the category of this problem.
2. How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?

## Approach

I know md5 is an old hash method so I searched for known collisions and found 2 exe files [here](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/).
I downloaded both the files and uploaded them on the website and got the error "Not a pdf" so I changed the .exe file to .pdf and uploaded again and got the flag.
