# Roboto Sans

## Problem Statement

The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.
Check this out.

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

None

## Approach

On navigating to robots.txt file I get the followibg text:

```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```
On base64 decoding the above we get a few file names and the flag is present inside `js/myfile.txt`.
