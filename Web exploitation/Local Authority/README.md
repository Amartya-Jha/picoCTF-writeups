## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. How is the password checked on this website?

## Approach

On inspecting the webpage I find a ```login.php``` file reference. On cheking the ./login.php webpage I see there's a js file ```secure.js``` .

In ```secure.js``` we see username and password is present in plain text.

using those credentials to login, we get our flag.
