# Scavenger Hunt

## Problem description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/. Can you find it?

## Type

Web exploitation

## Hints

You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Approach

we start off by viewing our page source and get first part of the flag in the html file

<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->

from here we move on to the css file linked and get the second part

/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */

then we head to the js file linked in the html page and we get a message

/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */

hmm, this one got me thinking a bit so i researched a bit and found that with "robots.txt" keeps google crawler away from a website, so i added "/robots.txt" at the end of the url

and landed on page with message:

User-agent: *

Disallow: /index.html

Part 3: t_0f_pl4c

I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?   

now, we know that apache based web servers use .htaccess config file, so we change directory to ".htaccess" and land on a new page with message

Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k

I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

now we change file to .DS_Store and get the final flag piece

Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _7a46d25d}
