# Scavenger Hunt

## Problem Statement

[website](http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/)

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Approach

On inspecting the website we find part 1/5 of the flag: picoCTF{t

In the stylesheet we find part 2/5 of the flag: h4ts_4_l0

In the js file we get the prompt "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?" which is done by a robots.txt file and we find our flag part 3/5: t_0f_pl4c

Our next clue is: I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
so we head to https://..../.htaccess and find flag part 4/5 : 3s_2_lO0k

Final clue for this is: I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
so we got to https://..../.DS_Store and find our final flag piece: _7a46d25d}

## Flag

picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_7a46d25d}
