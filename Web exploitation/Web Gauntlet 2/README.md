# Web Gauntlet 2

## Problem Statement

This website looks familiar... Log in as admin Site: http://mercury.picoctf.net:61434/ Filter: http://mercury.picoctf.net:61434/filter.php

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. I tried to make it a little bit less contrived since the mini competition.

2. Each filter is separated by a space. Spaces are not filtered.

3. There is only 1 round this time, when you beat it the flag will be in filter.php.

4. There is a length component now.

5. sqlite

## Approach

used concat to spell admin and except keyword.

username: `adm'||'in' except select`

password: `,''`
