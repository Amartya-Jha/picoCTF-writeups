## Problem Statement

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50009. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

1. There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
2. Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

## Approach
 used `' or '1'='1` for password and admin as username to get the flag
