## Problem Statement

My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help?
login.mars.picoctf.net

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints
None

## Approach

On inspecting the webpage, there's a javascript source file. 
In the file we find the username and password in a cryptic format which looked like base64. On using an online decoder we get username: admin
and password: picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r} which is also the flag.

The function ```btoa()``` was used to encode the strings to base64 in the js file.

## Flag

picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
