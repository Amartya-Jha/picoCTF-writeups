# Forbidden Paths

## Problem Statement

Can you get the flag?
Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55827/).
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Type

Web Exploitation

## Hints

None

## Approach

.. is not filtered so we do a bunch of `../` and get to `flag.txt`.
`../../../../../../../../flag.txt`.

Once we are in root `../` doesnt really do anything.
